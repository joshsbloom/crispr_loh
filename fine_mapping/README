Analysis code for
CRISPR-directed mitotic recombination enables genetic mapping without crosses 

This is the data set for the LOH fine-mapping panel targeting a region near PMR1

Data:

'Lphenos.RData'
a list containing colony radius measurements for LOH mitombinants
see trait 'manganese_sulfate;10mM' for the main focus of the publication 


'LOH.384.BYxRM.fm.w.Sanger.RData'
contains a numeric matrix
40647 markers by 358 mitombinants
containing LOH mitombinant genotypes for fine-mapping panel [0 = BY/BY 1 = BY/RM 2 = RM/RM]
this matrix has been updated with the genotype calls near PMR1 from Sanger sequencing data


Workflow for scripts:

1) fine_mapping_panel_processing.sh
    for alignments, sequence processing and vcf generation
2) processGenotypes_fm.R
    to extract genotypes from vcf and generate final genotypes for mapping
3) fine_mapping.R 
    to map traits in the fine-mapping panel
