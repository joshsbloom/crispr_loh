Analysis code for
CRISPR-directed mitotic recombination enables genetic mapping without crosses 

This is the data set for the LOH panel targeting the entire left arm of chromosome VII

Data:
 
'phenos.RData'
a list containing two sublists of colony radius measurements 
'Spheno' corresponds to phenotypes for BYxRM Segregants from Bloom 2013
'Lpheno' corresponds to phenotypes for LOH mitombinants

'BYxRM_LOH_segs.RData'
a numeric matrix 
40742 markers by 384 mitombinants
containing LOH mitombinant genotypes [0 = BY/BY 1 = BY/RM 2 = RM/RM]

'1000BYxRM_with_names.RData'
a numeric matrix
1040 segregants by 28220 markers [-1 = BY   1= RM ]



Workflow for scripts: 

1) full_panel_sequence_processing.zip [map.sh]
    for alignments, sequence processing and vcf generation
2) processGenotypes.R
    to extract genotypes from vcf and generate final genotypes for mapping
3) full_panel_mapping.R 
    to map traits in the full mapping panel and subset of BYxRM segregants
